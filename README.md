# Data Analysis for Social Buzz

In this work, we focus on a small dataset extracted from a large enterprise data set. The company has a platform that collects users' comments and reactions to celebrity-related events. The platform focuses on content by preserving the anonymity of all users and only tracking user reactions to each piece of content. Users can react to content in over 100 different ways, beyond the traditional ‘like’ and comment reactions.

Here we try to analyse the top 5 most popular categories of content using python.

The dataset is provided by [Accentured](https://www.accenture.com/us-en?c=acn_glb_sembrandpuregoogle_13513493&n=psgs_0323&&&&&&c=ad_usadfy17_10000001&n=psgs_Brand-%7C-US-%7C-Exact_accenture&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQiAs5i8BhDmARIsAGE4xHxiMdRfsW7dpoQFZUYoCy2h3UOrpW57WToW1EDvN35tsj-H6KItenQaAnGoEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds)
